# Assignment 4 – Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python

This repository contains solutions for:

## Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors
- Opens and reads `sample.txt`
- Prints content line by line
- Handles `FileNotFoundError` using try-except

## Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
- Takes user input and writes to `output.txt`
- Appends additional input to the same file
- Reads and displays final file content
- Uses proper error handling with try-except blocks

Run the programs with:

```bash
python task1_read_file.py
python task2_write_append_file.py
